# Project context
context: |
  Tech stack: Flutter, Dart
  Code Quality: Strict static analysis enforced.
  Workflow: Run analysis after completing all sub-tasks of a main task.

# Per-artifact rules
rules:
  tasks:
    - Run `flutter analyze` ONLY after ALL sub-tasks of a main task are completed (e.g., finish 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 -> then analyze).
    - Fix ALL reported issues, including `info` level hints, before marking the main task as complete.
    - Do not proceed to the next main task until `flutter analyze` passes cleanly with zero issues.
    - Ensure no `info`, `warning`, or `error` level issues remain in the codebase related to the implemented tasks.
